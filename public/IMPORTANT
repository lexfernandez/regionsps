Pavel Grivenko: please create database from your control panel . And go to /hsphere/local/home/moimart/ruby/regionsps.org modify config/database.yml with correct db connection settings for all modes:
Pavel Grivenko: development:
Pavel Grivenko: adapter: mysql
Pavel Grivenko: database: username_ruby (your database name)
Pavel Grivenko: username: username_ruby (your database username)
Pavel Grivenko: password: pass (your password)
Pavel Grivenko: host: mysql1202.hostexcellence.com
Pavel Grivenko: test:
Pavel Grivenko: adapter: mysql
Pavel Grivenko: database: username_ruby (your database name)
Pavel Grivenko: username: username_ruby (your database username)
Pavel Grivenko: password: pass (your password)
Pavel Grivenko: host: mysql1202.hostexcellence.com
Pavel Grivenko: production:
Pavel Grivenko: adapter: mysql
Pavel Grivenko: database: username_ruby (your database name)
Pavel Grivenko: username: username_ruby (your database username)
Pavel Grivenko: password: pass (your password)
Pavel Grivenko: host: mysql1202.hostexcellence.com
Pavel Grivenko: N.B. Database can be the same for all modes, and can be different if needed.
Pavel Grivenko: As I have found, you don't actually have databases created.
Pavel Grivenko: Please modify config/routes.rb so the code will look like this: map.connect ':controller/:action/:id' map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format' map.root :controller ? “home” end
Pavel Grivenko: N.B. by default it ends on:
Pavel Grivenko: map.connect ':controller/:action/:id'
Pavel Grivenko: map.connect ':controller/:action/:id.:format'
Pavel Grivenko: end
Pavel Grivenko: I can place a ticket for you with explanation for installation if you wish.
Pavel Grivenko: Where you will find all these instructions available.
